I made this purely to practice C since i have written almost no programs in it.
Inspired by cmatrix.

## Controls
- CTRL+Q to quit the program
- CTRL+C is allowed

## Make
Use `make all` to see all the make targets.

### Compiling
Run `make` or `make compile` which will create a binary in the `bin/` folder.

> If you want to change the compiler make uses, set the `C` variable. Example: `make C=gcc`
